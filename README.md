# Interactive Front-End Project #1 The Dinner Guru

Working professionals, especially parents, are requesting a simple web application that connects them to simple and easy recipes using ingredients they already have in their kitchen at home. Utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding languages, along with two server-side API's, client side storage, and Foundation framework, we developed a mobile ready, interactive web based application, to solve this problem, and making cooking at home easier.
